# Hyprland-1st-My-first-rice.
This is a horrible made rice for my future improvement/guidance


I think the requirement for ts is Oh-my-zsh! & powerlevel10k, i dunno if the dotfiles already includes or not.

Also Fuck neovim, I use VSCode or VSCodium to edit my files, although i been learning to use NVim, i don't see the point of using it.

EDIT: I have installed this on a VM to make sure what's missing and the nessecitys.

Forgot to put the followings: otf-awesome-nerd-font, pavucontrol, oh-my-zsh!, powerlevel10k, zsh.
This rice is mostly for laptops, and i forgot to take out my name when uploading the files so make sure you put your own directory for your own stuff.
